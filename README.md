# Sequential-Hierarchical-ERF-PSPNet

This code is the Pytorch implementation of Sequential/Hierarchical ERF-PSPNet architectures, which are designed for real-time semantic segmentation.

Hierarchical designs include 4x2 and 3x3 hierarchical archictures.
The input resolution is set to 640x480.

For training/deployment, please use the original code of [ERFNet] (https://github.com/Eromera/erfnet_pytorch)
